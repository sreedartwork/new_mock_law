new_mock_law using bootstrap 4 and gulp 4
This project was done using a bootstrap-4-gulp-4-sass-boilerplate.  I used this boilerplate primarily for the async and file compilation to the distribution folder.  I wanted to practice using bootstrap 4 in contrast to other frameworks that I have used such as Foundations by Zurb.
